    <h2>Dear Reader,</h2>
    <p>My name is Sabbina Ritvika, a passionate and dedicated student currently pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology at Shri Vishnu Engineering College for Women. Iâ€™ve always believed that learning is most powerful when driven by curiosity â€” and that's exactly how Iâ€™ve approached every subject, project, and challenge.
    From building web applications to designing user interfaces, I enjoy blending technology with creativity. My interest in full-stack development, combined with a strong eye for aesthetics, has helped me craft projects that are both functional and visually appealing.
    Beyond academics, I love organizing events, taking leadership roles, and collaborating with others.
    I'm enthusiastic about learning from experienced professionals and excited to grow in a real-time industry environment.
    Right now, Iâ€™m eagerly looking forward to getting placed in a reputed company where I can apply everything Iâ€™ve learned, contribute meaningfully, and continue evolving. I want to be part of a team where I can make a difference, while also learning from every experience that comes my way.</p>
    <p>This letter-style portfolio is a little glimpse into who I am â€” creative, hardworking, and hopeful. Thank you for taking the time to read it ðŸ’Œ</p>
    <p>Sabbina Ritvika</p>
